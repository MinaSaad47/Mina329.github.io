<blockquote>
<p>&quot;After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software
architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system
specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the
review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review
with an official review done-comment.&quot;</p>

be noted, checked, or remembered, or a set of rules or criteria against which a product
must be verified</li>

their knowledge, exploration of the test item and the results of previous tests</li>
